# Spotify CLI ðŸŽ§

Control Spotify playback on any device through the command line.

This repository is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/ledesmablt/spotify-cli). Due to [breaking changes in Python 3.10](https://github.com/ledesmablt/spotify-cli/issues/23#issue-1091200257), the commands `spotify auth login` and `spotify devices --switch-to <name>` would raise an `ImportError` due to the underlying PyInquirer dependency. I changed the PyInquirer dependency listed in [setup.py](setup.py) to use the GitHub repository, which is ahead of the PyPI release and supports Python 3.10. This simple fix should make this version of the application work now.

## Installation

This package only supports Python 3 and above.
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/vinlin24/spotify-cli.git
```

## Usage

This CLI performs all interactions through the Spotify API. All you need is a stable internet connection and an active Spotify session on any device.

Authorize the CLI & save your credentials locally.
```
$ spotify auth login
```

You may also pass [your own Spotify application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)'s
client ID and secret if you want to track your usage or avoid
API rate limiting issues (all users using the default client settings share the same rate limits).

When doing so, please ensure that [this URL](https://asia-east2-spotify-cli-283006.cloudfunctions.net/auth-redirect)
is listed as a Redirect URI in your application.
```
$ spotify auth login --client-id XXXXX --client-secret YYYYY
```


Start Spotify playback on any device and run the `spotify` command.
```

  "type": "album",
  "uri": "spotify:album:3mH6qwIy9crq0I9YQbOuDf"
}

## Notes
- Playback and device-related commands require at least one active Spotify session on any device.
  - You can just start and stop playback to "activate" your device.
  - Your device will remain "active" even when paused.
- Some operations may not be supported on certain devices (i.e. volume control for mobile) and for users not subscribed to Spotify Premium.
